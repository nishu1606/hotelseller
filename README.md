# hotelseller

This is the Seller App(Hotels) by using React.js. Firstally run the command for creating the folder. "npx create-react-app my-app(Name of your folder)".

After creating this, there are many files and folder inside your folder like src , public, pacakage.json , pacakge-lock.json etc folder. We mostly work inside our App.js folder. I used material ui icons for icons and bunttons. Create a different conponents which is reusable and you can easily render whenever you want. I am using map method for itterating the data. I simply use json data created by myself ,you can use api also. But I prefered json data beacause you understand the format of the json data Json data are in the form of Array of Object.

If you using material ui icon you install many packages and import into the folder.....

"npm install @mui/icons-material @mui/material @emotion/styled @emotion/react"

For pagination install- "npm i react pagination" You can also use the material usi pagination its your chooice.
